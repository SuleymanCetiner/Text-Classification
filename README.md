Here is a sample project for NLP. Myriad resources can be found as corpus to develop a lnaguage model that classifies docs.

Lots of classification models can be used but you can also fine tune the paramters to increase results.

Review polarity dataset is used here but also can be done by using other datasets.

In code, we use NLTK library to extract and process documents. After that develop a model and learns the patterns inside of corpus.
Depending on class numbers,model distinguishes the given docs as a positive or negative class.
